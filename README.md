We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/holidays
```

## Supported countries

We support the countries listed in [this directory](https://github.com/spatie/holidays/tree/main/src/Countries). If you want to add a country, please create a pull request.

## Usage

You can get all holidays for a country by using the `get` method.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holidays;
use Spatie\Holidays\Countries\Belgium;

// returns an array of Belgian holidays
// for the current year
$holidays = Holidays::for(Belgium::make())->get(); 
```

Alternatively, you could also pass an [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) code to the `for` method.
In case of region based holidays, these will not be included. Use a country class instead.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holidays;

// returns an array of Belgian holidays
// for the current year
$holidays = Holidays::for('be')->get();
```

### Getting holidays for a specific year

You can also pass a specific year.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holidays;

$holidays = Holidays::for(country: 'be', year: 2024))->get();
```

### Getting holidays between two dates

You can also get all holidays between two dates (inclusive).

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holidays;

$holidays = Holidays::for('be')->getInRange('2023-06-01', '2024-05-31');
```

### Determining if a date is a holiday 

If you need to see if a date is a holiday, you can use the `isHoliday` method.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holidays;

Holidays::for('be')->isHoliday('2024-01-01'); // true
```

### Getting the name of a holiday

If you need the name of the holiday, you can use the `getName` method.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holidays;

Holidays::for('be')->getName('2024-01-01'); // Nieuwjaar
```

### Package limitations
1. Islamic holidays are not supported (yet)

## Contributing

This is a community driven package. If you find any errors, please create an issue or a pull request.

## Adding a new country

1. Create a new class in the `Countries` directory. It should extend the `Country` class.
2. Add a test for the new country in the `tests` directory.
3. Run the tests so a snapshot gets created.
4. Verify the result in the newly created snapshot is correct.

In case your country has specific rules for calculating holidays,
for example region specific holidays, you can pass this to the constructor of your country class.

```php
$holidays = Holidays::for(Austria::make(region: 'de-bw'))->get();
```

The value, `de-bw`, will be passed to the region parameter of the constructor of a country.

```php
class Austria extends Country
{
    protected function __construct(
        protected ?string $region = null,
    ) {
    }

    protected function allHolidays(int $year): array
    {
        // Here you can use $this->region (or other variables) to calculate holidays
    }
```
