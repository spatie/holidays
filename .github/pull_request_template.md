# Contributing a new country ?

* [ ] Have you checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/spatie/holidays/pulls) for the same country?

1. Create a new class in the Countries directory. It should extend the Country class.
2. Add a test for the new country in the tests directory.
3. Run the tests so a snapshot gets created.
4. Verify the result in the newly created snapshot is correct.
